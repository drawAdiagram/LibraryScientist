###sierraholds.py
Requesting a list of outstanding holds from iii Sierra generates either a printable list or a "print to email" list. Having this in a spreadsheet would be more useful, but Sierra seems unable to create a csv version of the list of outstanding holds.

sierraholds.py will generate a .csv from a .txt list of outstanding holds.

This version removes page numbering ("Page x") and splits out patron info (name, patron number, email, phone) by line.
